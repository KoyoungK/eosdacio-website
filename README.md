## How to update a page?

## How to translate?

## How to suggest changes for discussion to the eosDAC Website?
 1. Fork to your own github account: https://github.com/eosdac/eosdacio-website
 2. Use tools you're familiar with to edit pages (Github website, Github Windows Client, etc)
 3. Create pull request back to the original upstream repository for your changes.

Since I'm using the command line tools, I go about it like so:
`git clone git@github.com:lukestokes/eosdacio-website.git`

Then I add an upstream so I can easily update my forked repo following the instructions here: <https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/>
```
# git remote add upstream https://github.com/eosdac/eosdacio-website.git
# git remote -v
origin    git@github.com:lukestokes/eosdacio-website.git (fetch)
origin    git@github.com:lukestokes/eosdacio-website.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/eosdac/eosdacio-website.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/eosdac/eosdacio-website.git (push)
```
