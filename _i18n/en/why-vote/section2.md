It is the vision of eosDAC that EOS.IO block production should be open for everyone to contribute and benefit. To realise this vision, eosDAC is an evolving Decentralised Autonomous Community (DAC) focused on EOS.IO Block Production serving the EOS communities worldwide. In doing this, eosDAC is creating the tools and smart contracts it needs to function. It will share these with the EOS communities to help other DACs thrive on the EOS.IO blockchains.

eosDAC is creating a DAC on the EOS blockchain, until then eosDAC is being run by its Team. eosDAC has spent most of the time since the EOS mainnet launch in June 2018 as an active block producer, meaning we have been continuously elected by the EOS community to be one of the 21 block producers on the chain
