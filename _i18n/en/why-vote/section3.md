**Digital decentralized communities can out compete centralized paper bureaucracies.**

    IMAGE: Show a computer network and pieces of paper, both spreading over a the world, show the DAC spreading faster and bigger until it swallows up the paper and replaces it with computers moving digital information around the world.

**Supporting DAC development helps the EOS ecosystem to grow.**

    IMAGE: show EOS as a balloon that is then being pushed up by a sea of DACâ€™s underneath it.
