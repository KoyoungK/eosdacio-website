**What** is a **DAC?**
===

DACs aren’t really that hard to understand, they’re essentially just digital organizations that use blockchain to do things that could never be done by traditional organizations. This is important because just like today’s apps are held by corporations and organizations, Dapps will need to be held by something, and it makes sense that Dapps be held by something digital and decentralized, which is exactly what a DAC offers over a traditional paper-based organization.

By bringing a way for DACs to easily be made on EOS, eosDAC thinks this will cause an explosion of new digital organizations that can massively benefit EOS and change the world.
